 * Conditionals 1.

 * Conditions are like questions.
 * They allow a program to decide to take one action if
 * the answer to a question is "true" or to do another action
 * if the answer to the question is "false."<br />
 * The questions asked within a program are always logical
 * or relational statements. For example, if the variable 'i' is
 * equal to zero then draw a line.
